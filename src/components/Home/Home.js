       Ambition is the key that may be hard-wired into our DNA; however, it only
       becomes activated when properly stimulated. Ambition and positivity are
       features of human nature that are recognized in our parents, our
       teachers, and our peers. These attributes are nurtured in many children
       as they move through their formative years and drives them to greatness
       in their field. As part of the Nord Anglia family of international
       schools, Compass International School Doha drives the same ambition
       towards each studentâ€™s education. This British International school is
       located over three campuses with over seventy nationalities and provides
       global opportunities for all its students.
