     <h1>Committed to educating and nurturing all students</h1>
     <p>
      Ambition is the key that may be hard-wired into our DNA; however, it only
      becomes activated when properly stimulated. Ambition and positivity are
      features of human nature that are recognized in our parents, our teachers,
      and our peers. These attributes are nurtured in many children as they move
      through their formative years and drives them to greatness in their field.
      As part of the Nord Anglia family of international schools, Compass
      International School Doha drives the same ambition towards each studentâ€™s
      education. This British International school is located over three
      campuses with over seventy nationalities and provides global opportunities
      for all its students.
